One beautiful day after reading [A love letter to my website- DESK Magazine](https://www.vanschneider.com/a-love-letter-to-personal-websites) sent by my friend [Bauva.Com](http://www.bauva.com/).I decided to buy a domain and build my *little corner of the internet*; this blog is about my experience about **my world** and how I perceive it to be, I will start with writing about *How I set up my website?*, starting from hosting on GitHub pages and setting up my DNS record by buying [sudarshan-sh.com](http://www.sudarshan-sh.com/) for *forever and ever*.

## Setting up Github Pages

[Github](https://www.github.com/) subsidiary of Microsoft surprisingly gives you free private repositories and features for hosting repositories as webpages :wink:. Now, for hosting a website, you can build a webpage using CSS, HTML or you can use some of the available Jekyll templates and play around with them. You can look for some of them at [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/), or this [theme](https://academicpages.github.io/) I used.

## Buying Domain

Once you have your $<$git_username$>$.github.io up and working next thing is buying your domain, nowhere be a little wise in picking up domain names as it will stay with you *forever and ever*. You can buy a domain at [GoDaddy,](https://in.godaddy.com/) [BIGROCK,](https://www.bigrock.in/) [Google Domains](https://domains.google/intl/en_in/) and [WiX.](https://www.wix.com/domain/names) I chose GoDaddy because of its excellent documentation, features and Integration in various other things which are required, which I will be talking about later.

## Linking domain to Github Pages

Now you have a domain, but you need to host it from somewhere some server (DNS), Since GoDaddy is widely used there tons of blogs on linking GoDaddy with Github Pages, I used [this blog](https://mycyberuniverse.com/configuring-a-godaddy-domain-name-with-github-pages.html).

## Setting up Mail Server

Setting up your *little corner of the internet* is incomplete without the email server, [me@sudarshan-sh.com](mailto:me@sudarshan-sh.com) is my contact email *forever and ever*. [ZOHO](https://www.zoho.com/mail/) provides free email hosting for Personal email serves up to 5 users, Integration is relatively simple, and GoDaddy is a plus.

I would strongly recommend you to create your website, start blogging sharing experiences and knowledge along with showcasing your skillset. Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:me@sudarshan-sh.com) if you need more help on this.
