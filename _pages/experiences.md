# Teaching

____

## Teaching Assistant, Dept. of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, India

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/kgp.png" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

I was teaching instructor for the following two courses at IIT Kharagpur. I was responsible for designing test materials, lab assignment and corresponding theory.

- Autumn 2019, EC39003- DIGITAL ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS LAB: Under [Prof. Indrajit Chakrabarti](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/EC/faculty/ec-indrajit).

<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

## IEEE Robotics Winter Workshop IIT Kharagpur

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/wws.png" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

I was one of the project heads and mentors during Decemeber 2016 from an IEEE certified robotics workshop at IIT Kharagpur. I mentored a group of 43 robotics enthusiasts from freshmen and sophomore year to build an Obstacle removing autonomous robot, worked on course content and evaluation metrics.

# Student Organization

___

## [KRSSG](https://krssg.in/index.html)

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/krssg.png" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

The group consists of a bunch of robotics enthusiasts working on the development of autonomous soccer-playing robots for participation in International Competitions like RoboCup and FIRA. Currently, I am the Student Advisor to the group with a focus on the Embedded Electronics team which is responsible for the design of FPGA based circuits involving communication with the base station and BLDC motor based control unit. During my third year, I led the team at Robocup 2017 at Nagoya, Japan (first Indian team at SSL Robocup).

<br/><br/>

## Analog PUF

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/puf.png" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

The project was an extension of my training at VLSI Summer School IIT Kharagpur, guided by [Prof. Mrigank Sharad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrigank-sharad-b2835b7/?originalSubdomain=in), presently at Dep. of Engineering Entrepreneurship IIT Kharagpur prev. Dept of E&ECE, IIT Kharagpur. The aim of the project is to design a low power multi-bit adaptive SRAM topology-based analog PUF which variations generated from the mismatch in the current mirror structures considered as bitcell. The other contributors of the project include Dhruv Thapar and Nikhil Bhelave Dept. of EE, IIT Kharagpur.

<br/><br/>

## Side Channel Analysis of Block Cipher GIFT

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/seal_lab.png" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

This project was my final year BTech project under [Prof. Debdeep Mukhopadhyay](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~debdeep/), CSE IIT Kharagpur. The project includes implementation of block cipher GIFT on FPGA, followed by its side-channel analysis using power traces (CPA attack was used), and then looking for the vulnerability in the threshold implementation of the cipher. Sayandeep Saha (PhD Student), SEAL Lab, CSE IIT Kharagpur was my mentor in this project.

<br/><br/>

## Rehabilitation Robotics

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/soft_computing.png" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

The group aims to develop an exoskeleton for the lower extremity of the human body consisting of actuators and feedback sensors, to impart a locomotive ability to the physically disabled people. For measuring the gait cycle collection of nodes consisting of IMU and RF module was developed.  Advised by [Prof D. K Pratihar](https://www1.iitkgp.ac.in/fac-profiles/showprofile.php?empcode=bUmdQ&depts_name=ME) and mentored by Abhishek Rudrapal (PhD Student) at Dep. ME IIT Kharagpur.
