Hi! I am a final year Dual Degree Student (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Microelectronics and VLSI Design under the department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), India. I am particularly interested in the field of VLSI, Computer Architecture, and Hardware Security. 

In Summer (2019), I interned at the [Qualcomm- Bangalore Design Center](https://www.qualcomm.com/company/locations/india), Bangalore, India in the Memory Design Team and was offered Pre-Placement Job Offer. 

Before this, I was VDEC Summer (2018) Research Intern at [FUJITA Lab](https://www.cad.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) under Prof. Masahiro Fujita, Director, VLSI Design and Education Center, The University of Tokyo.

In December (2018), I interned as a Car Electronics Engineer at [Pix Moving](https://www.pixmoving.com/), China, a mobility solution startup.

During my Sophomore years, I joined [KRSSG](https://krssg.in/index.html) and designed FPGA based circuit for soccer-playing Omni-wheel robots. I led the team for maiden participation in Robocup Nagoya Japan in (2017), Presently I am Student Advisor to the group.

During my spare time I enjoy following and playing football, I am a big [FC Barcelona](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/) Fan. Just an addition, I have fallen in love with F1 racing and cannot miss a race weekend. Moreover, I build some cool projects with FPGA's and Microcontrollers.
